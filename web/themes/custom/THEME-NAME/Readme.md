# THEME-NAME

This is a base setup for a theme utilising SCSS.

## Usage

*Note*
Before using, rename all instances of "THEME-NAME" if you did not already do this during the set up of the rest of the project.

For the most part this will work exactly like a normal Drupal theme. The only addition is the usage of SCSS to improve the experience of writing styles.\
If you choose to not use SCSS, simply delete the `package.json` and `gulpfile.js` utilised here.

To write SCSS for this theme simply place all files under a folder within this theme called `sass` and give every file an extension of `.scss`.\
You can nest folders within the name `sass` folder if you want to organise your style sheets more.
